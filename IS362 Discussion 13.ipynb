    "1) Perform a Scenario Design analysis as described below.  Consider whether it makes sense for your selected recommender system to perform scenario design twice, once for the organization (e.g. Amazon.com) and once for the organization's customers.\n",
    "2) Attempt to reverse engineer what you can about the site, from the site interface and any available information that you can find on the Internet or elsewhere.\n",
    "3) Include specific recommendations about how to improve the site's recommendation capabilities going forward. \n",
    "4) Create your report using a Jupyter notebook, and create a discussion thread with a link to the GitHub repo where your Jupyter Notebook resides.  You are not expected to need to write code for this discussion assignment.\n",

    "A Scenario Design analysis I decided to go with would be Google's search suggestions. Google analyzes scenarios for both Google and its users to be more insightful. \n",

    "    - Improve Search Relevance: Understanding user search behavior through scenarios can help Google refine algorithms to deliver more relevant and personalized suggestions. \n",
    "    - Identify New Search Trends: Scenario analysis can uncover emerging search patterns, allowing Google to anticipate user needs and potentially develop new features or products. \n",

    "    - Enhanced Search Efficiency: Understanding user scenarios can help Google tailor suggestions to specific search goals, leading to faster and more productive searches. \n",
    "    - Discover New Information Sources: Scenarios can help identify situations where users might benefit from exploring different types of content, like videos, news articles, or scholarly sources.\n",
    "    \n",
    "When reverse engineering Google's recommended system, they use a tactic to suggest the user topics based on your previous cookies in your browser. For example, if you type in \"Cars for sale\" on Google, it can suggest you Honda's website for reference based off your cookies or browser history data within your browser. They use this method to help gather customers with the recommended system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some ways that Google an improve their site's recommendation capabilities would be:\n",
    "   \n",
    "    - Allow Opt-out Options: Provide users with clear and easy ways to opt-out of personalized recommendations if they prefer a more generic search experience.\n",
    "    - Explain Recommendations: Briefly explain why a particular suggestion is presented. This builds trust and allows users to understand the logic behind the recommendation system."
